# Conference Expense Planner

## Description
This is a conference event planning and pricing tool I developed for BudgetEase, a company that helps businesses manage event costs efficiently. The application built using **Vite** and **React 18**. The goal of this application is to help users, who manages a venues easily to calculate the total cost of a conference by selecting rooms, equipment add-ons, and meal packages for a given number of attendees.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, I was able to:
  - Build React Components: Create reusable functional components using proper composition and nesting to keep the UI modular and organized.
  - Work with React Hooks: Implemented useState and useEffect to manage local component state and control visibility and behavior of UI elements.
  - Integrate Redux Toolkit: Used Redux Toolkit to structure the app’s state using slices, actions, reducers, and a central redux store for better scalability and maintainability.
  - Render Dynamic Data: Mapped through arrays of objects to render components dynamically and keep the UI in sync with the state.
  - Handle User Interactions: Captured user actions like button clicks, applied conditional rendering, and triggered logic to update the interface responsively.

## Features
- Interactive UI: Real-time updates based on user selections to provide instant feedback.
- Venue & Add-on Selection: Components to pick from available rooms, microphones, projectors, and other event essentials.
- Meal Planning: Allows users to choose meal options based on guest count.
- State Management with Redux Toolkit: I used Redux slices to manage the state of venue selection, add-ons, meals, and pricing.
- Cost Breakdown Display: Shows selected items in a pop-up table format with subtotals and a final total cost.

## Deployment
The application is deployed using GitHub Pages, providing a simple and reliable way to host static sites. Here's the link to the application: [https://sandyavs.github.io/e-plantShopping/](https://sandyavs.github.io/conference_expense_planner/)
